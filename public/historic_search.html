		<p> Komb allows you to input a stock ticker symbol, and retrieve the company's perfomance over the past two years. Additionally, Komb will calculate for you EPS, ROA, and Current ratio for the company from 2 years ago.</p><br>
		<p> The idea is that if you have a successful company in mind, you can get what financial metrics for the company looked like from 2 years ago. (You are also provided the company's trajectory over the last 2 years to confirm your insights on the company.)</p><br>
		<p> You can then use these metrics to find the next company that will perform like this company!. Go ahead... Give it a try. Make sure you use a ticker symbol in the format such as AMZN.</p><br>
